Mineplex Stat Tracker
===================

***This program is not affiliated in any way with Mojang or Mineplex***

This program simply reads the Minecraft chat log and looks for specific messages and commands and
records kills and deaths from minigames on the Mineplex server.

There are two commands which can be executed on the Mineplex server which interact with the program:

**/? r** - Will reset statistics recorded by the program

**/? l** - Will log statistics recorded by the program to a file in Documents\Mineplex Stats\Logs

This program will not likely be updated much more.
